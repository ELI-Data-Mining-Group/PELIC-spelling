## 1. Overview
This README.md file introduces the the dataset for the Pittsburgh English Language Institute Corpus (PELIC), a large learner corpus of written and spoken texts. These texts were collected in an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) context over seven years in the University of Pittsburghâ€™s Intensive English Program, and were produced by students with a wide range of linguistic backgrounds and proficiency levels. Unlike most learner corpora which are cross-sectional (Callies, 2015), PELIC is quasi-longitudinal, offering greater opportunities for tracking development in a natural classroom setting.

In Section 2 we describe some of the key characteristics of this corpus, and Section 3 addresses how the data were collected and processed. Section 4 provides information about each of the files corpus in the repository so that they may be easily accessed and used for linguistic research. Sections 5 and 6 look at accompanying bespoke resources for processing this, or other, corpus data. Finally, Section 7 suggests possible avenues for future data release and development.

Overall, the corpus contributes to the field of learner corpus research by adding to the pool of freely and publicly available learner corpora, supplemented by a useful set of tools and tutorials for accessing these data. For information regarding publications and presentations based on PELIC data, as well as for information regarding the people and parties responsible for the corpus, please visit the [Pitt ELI Corpus](https://github.com/ELI-Data-Mining-Group/Pitt-ELI-Corpus) repository.
